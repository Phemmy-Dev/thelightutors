            Class reports are sent to a WhatsApp group after each class.  This class report contains very detailed information about how each class went and also the child’s behaviour in classes. Using google classrooms as well, scores of assignments and tests are accessible to the parents. Progress reports are also sent if requested by parents. This is sent monthly but can be reviewed as desired by parents.
